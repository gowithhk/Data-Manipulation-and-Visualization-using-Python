# Data-Manipulation-and-Visualization-using-Python
 This project is more of a training module which helps you understand how data manipulation and visualization can be done on Python. It will take multiple smaller datasets or will create dataframes to teach important concepts that we use in common data manipulation and visualization.
 
 The project will be focused around the use of **Pandas** and *MatPlotLib* libraries of Python programming. In a professional setting, you would work on larger datasets however, the same concepts are going to be applied on smaller datasets in this project.
